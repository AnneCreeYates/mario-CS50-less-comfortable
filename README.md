# mario-CS50-less-comfortable
This is the solution to the CS50 mario (less comfortable) pset1 project. The code is in C and it contains additional libraries that work only in CS50 IDE (#include <stdio.h> #include <cs50.h>). The code requests the user to provide a positive integer between 1 and 8 inclusive and then prints out 1 triage composed of a given number of hashtags. To see an example see CS50 problem set 1 mario: https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/psets/1/mario/less/
